# Giotto

Tested with SDL2.0.5

GfxCanvasBgi class based on code from here: http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net/ (SDL_bgi).

Small demo app available. See main.cpp

Added some bitmap fonts I found many years ago on the internet. See ./Giotto/bgi/fntNAME.hpp files. All are based on binary files with the filename NAME.fnt and where converted to C++ header files by code in Playground.cpp. If you think there is a copyright issue at play please message me asap.
